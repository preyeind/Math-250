## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). 'include: false' to run the code but not show anything, 'eval: false' to show but not run code

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's actually load 'tidyverse' but silence the message.

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
glimpse(penguins)

```

## Boxplots

Let's get a boxplot showing 'bill_len' by 'species'.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_len, 
                     y = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

By the way, *never* include interactive commands like 'view' and 'install.packages' in a Quarto document.

Let's try and silence that warning.
```{r}
#| warning: false


ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_len, 
                     x = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Here, two observations are missing. We should investigate.
