library(tidyverse)
color_survey <- read.csv("color_survey.csv")
```

The first row in the `color_survey` set has color `#4864af`. What does this mean??

How much red, green, and blue is in a color. We read this in pairs, giving us red, green, and blue components. Here, 48 red. These values are in *hexidecimal*, or just *hex*, which means they're base 16.

The hex number 48 means 4 sixteens and 8 ones. This is 16*4 + 8 = 72.

What about the blue component, af? In hex, a is 10, b is 11, etc., so af is 10 sixteens and 15 ones. So, 16*10 + 15 = 175.

If you put the color code in a code chunk, R studio will show it to you.

```{r}
"#4864af"
```
