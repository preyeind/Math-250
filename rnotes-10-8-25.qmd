First, let's include an image in our document. Make sure `dumpster_fire.jpeg` is in your project folder.

![This is a label for the cool dumpster fire image](dumpster_fire.jpeg)

If you need, you can read about resizing this, etc. The label serves as alt text.

Another very important Quarto thing is footnotes^[like this].

## Project planning

I strongly reccomend a two-step process as you choose your topic.

1) First, generate **lots** of ideas. Don't judge. Write them down. This means making a bunch of plots and numerical summaries, and it also means reading more about the data and about color.

Wait until a different day.

2) Cross off the ones that are too hard or too basic. Decide on your top 3. Start with number 1 and then make some exploratory plots to see if it's actually working.

## Pivoting!

Remember, `pivot_longer` handles when some columns have names that are actually values of an unnamed variable. Let's consider `billboard` as an example.

```{r}
glimpse(billboard)
```
We need to convert the `wk` columns using `pivot_longer`.

```{r}
billboard_long <- billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = wk1:wk76,
              names_to = "week",
              values_to = "ranking")

billboard_long %>%
  arrange(ranking) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

Wishlist:

- So many stupid `NA`s

- The word `week` is repeated in an unhelpful way.


```{r}
billboard_long <- billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"),
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE,
               names_prefix = "wk",
               names_transform = as.numeric)

glimpse(billboard_long)
```

Let's try the plot again:

```{r}
ggplot(billboard_long, aes(x = week,
                           y = rank,
                           color = track)) + 
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) 
```

I only want to keep songs that charted at least a year. To do this, I'm going to add a column showing the total number of weeks the song charted. 

```{r}
billboard_long <- billboard_long %>% 
  group_by(track) %>% 
  mutate(weeks_charted = max(week)) %>% 
  filter(weeks_charted >= 52)

glimpse(billboard_long)

ggplot(billboard_long, aes(x = week,
                           y = rank,
                           color = track)) + 
  geom_line(show.legend = TRUE) 
```


```{r}
billboard_long <- billboard_long %>% 
  mutate(date = date.entered + 7 * (week - 1))

glimpse(billboard_long)

ggplot(billboard_long, aes(x = date,
                           y = rank,
                           color = track)) + 
  geom_line(show.legend = TRUE) 
```

## Pivot Wider

Let's look at `table2`. Here, the names of variables are included in the `type` column. The corresponding values are in the count column. There are two rows per

NOTE: `pivot_longer` is for when column names are values of variable. `pivot_wider` is for when values in a column are names of a variable.

```{r}
table2
```

To tidy this, we need to let R know 3 things:

- how to identify observations (which columns). For us, `country` and `year`.

- the column names where the variable names are currently housed.

- the column where the variable values are currently housed

```{r}
table2_wide <- table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(country, year),
              names_from = type,
              values_from = count)
table2_wide
```

## Combined variables

Sometimes a column includes more than 1 variable. The simplest tool for handling this is `seperate`.

```{r}
table3
```

Let's separate this.

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(col = rate,
           into = c("cases", "population"),)
```
